## Description  
This is an introduction to the fundamentals of tagging in Databricks Unity Catalog. You will learn how to apply user-defined tags to schemas and tables, verify and audit them through information schema queries, and use stored procedures to automate tagging across multiple objects. The lab also introduces governed and system tags, highlighting their role in consistency, compliance, and enterprise-wide governance. By the end, you will understand how tagging supports discoverability and governance across your Unity Catalog objects.  



## Learning Objectives  
- Apply user-defined tags to schemas and tables in Unity Catalog using SQL commands  
- Query information schema views to verify and audit applied tags  
- Automate the application of standard tags across multiple tables using stored procedures  
- Differentiate between user-defined, governed, and system tags and explain when to use each

## Requirements & Prerequisites  
Before starting, ensure you have:  
- A Databricks workspace (any edition with Unity Catalog enabled)
- A SQL Warehouse to execute the statements
- Permissions to create a schema and tables in a catalog you own (so you can tag them)
- Basic familiarity with SQL commands
- Knowledge of Databricks SQL stored procedures and SQL Scripting is beneficial if you plan to automate tagging.
