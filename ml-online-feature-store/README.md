## Description  
This lab explores the implementation of online feature stores in Databricks, focusing on real-time feature serving and on-demand feature computation. You'll learn to set up online stores, publish feature tables, create Python UDFs for dynamic feature generation, and deploy models that automatically handle feature lookups during inference.

## Learning Objectives
- Configure and manage online feature stores for low-latency feature access
- Understand prerequisites for publishing feature tables to online stores
- Create Python UDFs for on-demand feature computation
- Publish feature tables to online stores and manage synchronization
- Build training sets that combine online lookups with on-demand features
- Deploy models with automatic feature lookup capabilities
- Inference models registered to Unity Catalog with automatic feature lookups

## Requirements & Prerequisites  
<!-- Example list below – update or replace with the specific requirements for your lab -->
Before starting this lab, ensure you have:  
- A **Databricks** workspace  
- The ability to create a Lakebase instance in your workspace
- Write access to a catalog you own in Unity Catalog  
- Basic knowledge of SQL
- Basic knowledge of Python
- Basic knowledge of deploying machine learning models
