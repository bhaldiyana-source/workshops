- Stream processing (IoT data, log analytics)
- Third-party webhooks (payment processed, email received)

Event Processing Patterns:

Fan-Out:
Single event triggers multiple parallel functions
Example: Image upload → resize, thumbnail, metadata extraction, virus scan

Choreography:
Functions emit events consumed by other functions
Example: Order placement → inventory check → payment → fulfillment → notification

Orchestration:
Central workflow coordinates function execution
Example: Multi-step approval process with conditionals and error handling

Stream Processing:
Continuous processing of event streams
Example: Real-time analytics on clickstream data
