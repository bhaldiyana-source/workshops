3. INSTALLATION STEPS
========================================

Step 1: Download Installation Package
--------------------------------------
Visit the official website and download the latest installation package:
- Navigate to https://download.productxyz.com
- Select your operating system
- Choose the appropriate version (Standard or Enterprise)
- Download the installer package

The package will be approximately 2.5 GB in size. Download time will vary based on your internet connection speed.

Step 2: Verify Package Integrity
---------------------------------
Before installation, verify the downloaded package:

For Linux/Mac:
$ sha256sum product-xyz-installer.tar.gz
$ cat product-xyz-installer.tar.gz.sha256

Compare the checksums to ensure file integrity. If checksums do not match, re-download the package.

For Windows:
> certutil -hashfile product-xyz-installer.exe SHA256

Step 3: Extract and Prepare
----------------------------
Extract the installation files:

Linux/Mac:
$ tar -xzf product-xyz-installer.tar.gz
$ cd product-xyz-installer

Windows:
Right-click the installer and select "Run as Administrator"

Step 4: Run Pre-installation Checks
------------------------------------
The installer includes a pre-flight check utility:

$ ./preflight-check.sh

This will verify:
- System meets minimum requirements
- Required ports are available
- Dependencies are installed
- Sufficient disk space is available
- Network connectivity is established

Address any warnings or errors before proceeding.

Step 5: Execute Installation
-----------------------------
Run the main installation script:

Linux/Mac:
$ sudo ./install.sh --mode interactive

Windows:
Run installer.exe and follow the GUI prompts

During installation, you will be prompted for:
- Installation directory (default: /opt/product-xyz)
- Administrator email address
- Database configuration
- SSL certificate information
- License key

The installation process typically takes 10-15 minutes.

Step 6: Verify Installation
----------------------------
After installation completes, verify the services are running:

$ sudo systemctl status product-xyz
$ curl http://localhost:8080/health

Expected output:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "uptime": "00:00:45"
}

5. TROUBLESHOOTING
========================================

Common Installation Issues
--------------------------

Issue: Installation fails with "Permission Denied"
Solution: Ensure you're running the installer with administrator/root privileges
Command: sudo ./install.sh

Issue: Port 8080 already in use
Solution: Either stop the conflicting service or configure Product XYZ to use a different port
Command: product-xyz-cli config set server.port 8081

Issue: Database connection fails
Solution: 
1. Verify database server is running
2. Check firewall rules allow connection on port 5432
3. Confirm credentials are correct
4. Ensure database exists and user has appropriate permissions

Issue: Service won't start after installation
Solution:
1. Check service logs: journalctl -u product-xyz
2. Verify configuration file syntax: product-xyz-cli config validate
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed: ./preflight-check.sh
4. Check disk space: df -h

Performance Issues
------------------

Symptom: Slow response times
Possible Causes:
- Insufficient memory allocation
- Database not optimized
- Network latency
- Concurrent user limit reached

Solutions:
1. Increase memory allocation in config file
2. Optimize database indexes
3. Enable caching
4. Scale horizontally by adding nodes

Symptom: High CPU usage
Possible Causes:
- Resource-intensive queries
- Background jobs running
- Memory swapping

Solutions:
1. Review and optimize queries
2. Adjust job scheduling
3. Increase available RAM
4. Enable query caching
