## Description  

In this lab, you will learn how to build an interactive AI/BI dashboard in Databricks from start to finish. You'll connect to prepared datasets, write SQL queries for custom visualizations, and design multiple dashboard pages using widgets such as counters, charts, maps, and filters. You'll also create parameters to make your dashboard dynamic, apply a custom theme, and publish it for sharing and exploration. You will then use Databricks One to view your dashboard and Genie space! 

After completing the guided steps, you'll be ready to enhance the dashboard with your own data and visualizations to explore further!

## Learning Objectives  
- Create and prepare sample datasets for use in Databricks AI/BI dashboards.
- Build a multi-page interactive dashboard from scratch.
- Add datasets, SQL queries, and parameters to power dynamic visualizations.
- Design and create widgets such as counters, filters, charts, maps, and Sankey diagrams.
- Publish and share your dashboard securely within Databricks.
- Introduce Databricks One to show how business users can easily access and explore data and AI assets from a single interface.
- Introduce Genie to explore dashboards through natural-language questions and insights.
