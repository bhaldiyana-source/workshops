## Description  
This lab showcases how to build and deploy a Genie Agent that leverages Unity Catalog functions for natural language data querying. You will learn to create table-valued functions that work seamlessly with Genie and perform a basic configuration of a Genie space.

## Learning Objectives
- Create Unity Catalog functions for Genie integration
- Convert scalar functions to table-valued functions for Genie compatibility
- Configure and test a Genie space with custom functions
- Query Genie spaces using natural language and interpret the results and view the tool-calling capabilities of the agent
